Sign Language MNIST Classification
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of American Sign Language letters (A-Z) using the Sign Language MNIST dataset. The model can identify 26 unique classes, representing each letter of the alphabet. The CNN architecture has multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling, dropout for regularization, and dense layers for classification.

Sign Language MNIST Dataset
Running the Project
To run this project, execute the script in a Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks:

Load and preprocess the dataset, which includes separating labels from images, reshaping images for the CNN, and normalizing pixel values.
Use one-hot encoding on the labels for categorical classification.
Build a CNN model with layers optimized for image classification tasks.
Train the model on the training set and validate it on the test set.
Visualize training accuracy and loss to understand model performance.
Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layer: Extracts features from images.
MaxPooling: Reduces spatial dimensions and controls overfitting.
Flatten: Converts the 3D feature maps into 1D for dense layers.
Dense Layer: Performs classification with softmax activation for 26 output classes.
Training and Evaluation
The model is trained over 5 epochs using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer. After training, the model’s accuracy is evaluated on the test set.

Visualizations
Training and Validation Accuracy: Plot to show accuracy improvements over epochs.
Training and Validation Loss: Plot to show loss reduction over epochs.

Results
The model typically achieves an accuracy of ~0.85% on the test set, indicating the model’s ability to classify sign language gestures.
